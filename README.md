# MinerInsight
MinerInsight is a lightweight webserver/app meant to be ran locally.
It tracks the performance of crypto mining machines on the network no matter what software they're using to mine.
It's great for miners with a lot of machines that want to have insigt on all of them in one place, even if they're mining different currencies or using different softwares!
